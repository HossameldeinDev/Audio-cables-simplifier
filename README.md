# Audio-cables-simplifier
audio system simplifier. A big audio system uses 18 cables to control 18 output over 200 meters. The system was developed to use only one cable and transfer the data by UART using 2 Atmega16 boards.

and here's a picture featuring the finished application. where 18 buttons are used to control 18 outpue (which represents 18 speakers) and the 19s button is controlling the whole 18 output for opening or closing all of them at once.

the output in negative logic to it's compitable with the circuit designed to convert the 5 volt to 12 volt.
